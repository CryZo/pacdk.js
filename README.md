# Pacdk.js
This project allows you to host every pacdk based game as web app. Just copy your game files from `yourgame/data/` to `./data/` and launch the server.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still wip. You can load rooms, interact with objects and characters and launch cutscenes. However many things won't work at the moment. It's still a long road. Also encrypted game files are not supported yet.

> [!NOTE]  
> At the moment assets will be fetched when they're needed. However it takes a bit to load them. As soon as an asset was fetched it will be cached localy. So a good practice during development is to run a cutscene once, have a coffee and then run it again.
